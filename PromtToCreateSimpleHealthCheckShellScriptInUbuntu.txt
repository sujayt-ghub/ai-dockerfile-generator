Create a shell script where the script should analyze health of the virtual machine based on the cpu, memory and disk space. If any of these three things are less than 60 percent utilized, the script declares the state of vm as healthy. Whereas if any of these parameters are more than 60 percent, script declares the health as Not healthy. Also, the script should support a command line argument named "explain", when passed the script should explain the reason for health status. Target virtual machines are always ubuntu.
